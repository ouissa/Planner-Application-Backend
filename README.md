# Planner

Planner allows students to make their degree plans and avoid problems with their degree requirements.

## Description

AUI students need to develop an adequate degree plan and schedule to predict their
time of graduation and insight on the action they should take to achieve their academic
goals. Therefore, to further develop and sophisticate this process, there is a need to develop
a cloud software solution that allows students to drag and drop courses in their degree plan
as well as suggest a recommended degree plan and schedule for their following semester
considering the criteria found below to satisfy their requirements and needs.
The application to be developed shall hold a collection of courses and their details,
professors and their respective disciplines, and students’ first and last name, email address,
major, minor (if declared), year (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior).
In addition, students will be able to rate courses after they have taken them to improve
the software’s suggestions.
